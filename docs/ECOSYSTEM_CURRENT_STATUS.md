# Ecosystem Current Status Snapshot

**Snapshot date:** 2026-10-09  
**Source:** GitHub repository inventory and the current README files fetched for the listed repositories.  
**Evidence class:** inventory checked; project maturity labels below are repository-declared statements, **not an independent implementation or CI verification**.

## Inventory

The organization inventory returned **33 repositories: 26 not archived and 7 archived**. “Not archived” is a GitHub repository flag, not proof that a repository is actively maintained or production-ready.

### Not archived (26)

| Repository | README-declared status / current documentation note |
|---|---|
| `.github` | Organization policy and generated repository-scope inventory; generated counts must not be hand-edited. |
| `a-townchain` | Development; README explicitly says not production-ready and Mainnet NO-GO. |
| `a-townchain-ecosystem` | Architecture/integration and evidence control plane; current architecture PRs are proposals until merged and evidenced. |
| `a-townchain-os` | Development; integration/orchestration repository, not a substitute for canonical component repositories. |
| `a-townchain-os-docs` | Documentation hub. Older inventory and status material is stale; see this snapshot. |
| `atc-algorithm` | Development; README describes MVP/skeleton, not a production consensus engine. |
| `atc-compute` | Development/rebuild-era description in README; production readiness not established here. |
| `atc-contracts` | README labels M6 as CLAIMED, not VERIFIED. |
| `atc-engineering` | README reports partial implementation; not a production platform. |
| `atc-ide` | Experimental; README says no production build or application test suite. Markdown Lint workflow exists; PR [#2](https://github.com/A-TownChain-Okosystems/atc-ide/pull/2) corrects the inaccurate “no CI gates” statement. |
| `atc-launchpad` | Development; README describes initial skeleton. |
| `atc-marketplace` | README is a short restored/legacy description; current maturity is not established by this inventory. |
| `atc-node` | Development; no production readiness implied by documented commands or tests. |
| `atc-sdk` | Development; protocol and VM semantics remain owned by canonical components. |
| `atc-shivacore` | Development / NOT_READY; supporting specifications and governance only. Canonical kernel source is in `globus-os/modules/atc-shivacore/kernel/`. |
| `atc-standards` | Canonical normative standards source. Read its generated state block and registry at the checked-out revision; do not copy mutable metrics into this hub. |
| `atc-toolchain` | Development / R1 skeleton per README; exact-SHA verification not established in this snapshot. A license-description wording correction is proposed in PR [#2](https://github.com/A-TownChain-Okosystems/atc-toolchain/pull/2). |
| `atc-vm` | Development; README describes an R1 skeleton. Canonical production VM implementation is `a-townchain/components/vm`; this repo must not be treated as a competing implementation. |
| `atc-zkp` | Development / R1 skeleton according to README. |
| `atclang` | Development; README explicitly says not production-ready. |
| `aurora-ai` | Development; no production claim. Aurora AI is not the ShivaCore TCB or canonical chain/consensus authority. |
| `demo-repository` | GitHub demo/template repository; no ecosystem product maturity claim inferred. |
| `genesis-chronicles` | Development; game/reference project, not evidence of platform production readiness. |
| `genesis-engine` | Development. |
| `genesis-franchise-factory` | Experimental (R1) according to README. |
| `globus-os` | Development; operating-system implementation is not thereby verified or production-ready. |

### Archived (7)

`atc-explorer`, `atc-indexer`, `atc-interop`, `atc-mining`, `atc-oracle`, `atc-storage`, `atc-wallet`.

Archive status is taken from the repository inventory response on the snapshot date. Archived repositories are not targets for active documentation refresh unless they are explicitly reactivated.

> **Standards-state note:** the checked-in generated `atc-standards` README/STATUS snapshot inspected on 2026-10-09 is generated at `2026-10-07 22:43 UTC+2`, State ID `ATC-STATE-20261007-ca5c3b44`, registry SHA-256 `ca5c3b445fc45382417d7b3013a8229fc736aadcc6f2a3c8420736bdd316610b`. The generated views were not manually edited in this refresh. Regeneration must follow the canonical generator and current registry source.

## Canonical ownership / SSOT boundaries

- **Normative standards:** `atc-standards` is the source of truth. `a-townchain-os-docs/docs/standards/` is an archival/reference snapshot, not a competing normative registry.
- **Blockchain core:** `a-townchain`.
- **Canonical ATC-VM implementation:** `a-townchain/components/vm`. A separate repository must not silently become a second production VM.
- **Canonical algorithm/consensus implementation:** `a-townchain/components/algorithm`.
- **Canonical ShivaCore kernel source:** `globus-os/modules/atc-shivacore/kernel/`. `atc-shivacore` owns supporting specifications/governance, not a competing kernel.
- **Integration and evidence control plane:** `a-townchain-ecosystem`; it must not duplicate component implementations.
- **System orchestration:** `a-townchain-os`; it coordinates integration and validation, not ownership of every component implementation.
- **Aurora AI:** AI/service layer. It does not replace ShivaCore security enforcement, consensus, ATC-VM, or canonical chain authority.

## Evidence semantics

- **IMPLEMENTED** means code or a documented artifact exists; it does not mean the behavior has passed verification.
- **VERIFIED** requires evidence tied to the exact commit SHA being claimed, including the relevant workflow run, job, step, exit status and logs. A PR merge reference, a badge, a historical green run, or README wording alone is insufficient.
- **BLOCKED / RESIDUAL** findings remain visible until corrected and rechecked. A green unrelated workflow does not close them.
- Do not weaken required CI gates to make a status appear green. Do not label a component audited, production-ready, or Mainnet-ready unless the relevant release gates and evidence support that exact claim.
- This document does not independently run repository CI and does not upgrade any project state to VERIFIED.

## Stale source files

- The README previously stated **128 repositories, 2 active and 126 archived** and carried a 2026-09-03 update date. Those numbers do not match the organization inventory fetched on 2026-10-09.
- `STATUS.md` contains an auto-generated 2026-08-04 snapshot with obsolete metrics and superseded issue references; it must not be used as current live status.
- The previous `REALITY_STATUS.md` contained dated historical observations and claimed to be authoritative. It is now a deprecation notice; its previous contents remain in Git history. Use this snapshot only for the limited inventory and README-declared labels stated above.
- Repository-specific implementation state must be refreshed from each repository's canonical status/evidence files and exact-SHA CI records before any claim is upgraded.

## Default-branch exact-SHA CI snapshot

**Snapshot date:** 2026-10-09. Each SHA below is the repository's `main` commit fetched from GitHub. The check-run summary is from the API query for that exact SHA. “No checks returned” means no check runs were returned by that query; it does **not** prove the repository has no CI or that its code passed. A passing subset does not imply complete verification.

| Repository | `main` SHA | Observed check-run summary |
|---|---|---|
| `.github` | `eeacedf33fd4b81046a3ee56eb1c815836bd9833` | Two visible checks passed: analysis and quality. |
| `a-townchain` | `b9f13056fb62cc2cbfc5747c8467ccb157fdc5f4` | Two visible language-analysis checks passed; no build/test/determinism check was returned for this SHA. |
| `a-townchain-ecosystem` | `7ba6584961ca922f080441e7aba526263298fd2f` | Three visible checks passed: audit and JavaScript/Python analysis; no end-to-end integration gate was returned for this SHA. |
| `a-townchain-os` | `8f5df13dba2918ea3f53f6edb24d00ca9748013a` | Latest visible audit failed ([run](https://github.com/A-TownChain-Okosystems/a-townchain-os/actions/runs/37859839310/job/113592671905)); quality and integration passed. |
| `a-townchain-os-docs` | `be6271ebe8b20510f2dcf87a1dfbccbcbf0386da` | Seven visible checks passed, including docs, audit and docs-smoke. This is main, not the open PR #40 head. |
| `atc-algorithm` | `69eeed5eb837d067d8c15791d5178b94a8d8724c` | Cargo tests and determinism failed ([tests](https://github.com/A-TownChain-Okosystems/atc-algorithm/actions/runs/37594109230/job/112702405880), [determinism](https://github.com/A-TownChain-Okosystems/atc-algorithm/actions/runs/37594108991/job/112702404270)); audit, security and analysis checks passed. |
| `atc-compute` | `8283afc3697e9c193e05c8ea3deb78a9133bf4e4` | No check runs returned for this SHA; current CI state is UNKNOWN from this query. |
| `atc-contracts` | `a7c8b417f482665ef30e94fcacae6469c28b1125` | ATCLang conformance and determinism failed ([conformance](https://github.com/A-TownChain-Okosystems/atc-contracts/actions/runs/37430837176/job/112161055391), [determinism](https://github.com/A-TownChain-Okosystems/atc-contracts/actions/runs/37430837162/job/112161054945)); several other visible checks passed. |
| `atc-engineering` | `470e6a9f500fdade0ea33065d30dd76b58d6492b` | Fleet audit failed ([run](https://github.com/A-TownChain-Okosystems/atc-engineering/actions/runs/37479559720/job/112323983273)); Markdown lint, verification and self-test passed. |
| `atc-ide` | `18ea7e8cd855c8404c9e291c931713e073146021` | JavaScript analysis and Markdown lint passed; no application test suite is declared. |
| `atc-launchpad` | `9bd5aeaf2dd90966c92c9451e7da7166964c829f` | No check runs returned for this SHA; current CI state is UNKNOWN from this query. |
| `atc-marketplace` | `4ebd6f8dd9e1d4bc49c455d25e184b9b6bd48e79` | One visible JavaScript/TypeScript analysis check passed. |
| `atc-node` | `1ee3a3aee6d66681debca7934cd9aaa9e1051ee2` | Nine visible checks passed, including Cargo tests, determinism, conformance, audit and CodeQL. |
| `atc-sdk` | `3ff63fe3a8232a3bcab52087d054634fe3dfd8e8` | Thirteen visible checks passed across Rust, TypeScript, Python, audit and test jobs. |
| `atc-shivacore` | `7f93d3ff25738e6888ecf6fb40cbe8614a8cab56` | One visible Python analysis check passed; its evidence registry still declares tests `not_run`, security `not_audited`, conformance `not_verified`, and `latest_verified: null`. |
| `atc-standards` | `65d43b6b3ac2e82723bfd9bc2a10d001e3cc0fc9` | Registry, conformance, quality and most checks passed, but the generated-view `regenerate` job failed only at automatic PR creation because GitHub Actions lacks `createPullRequest` permission ([run](https://github.com/A-TownChain-Okosystems/atc-standards/actions/runs/37852488615/job/113568631862)). The generator did produce branch/PR [#102](https://github.com/A-TownChain-Okosystems/atc-standards/pull/102); review it. Do not hand-edit generated files. |
| `atc-toolchain` | `090af476a5fb38e8b219754646991532e8b8fcda` | Six visible checks passed, including smoke and audit. |
| `atc-vm` | `21132a49355eb5fd6ea4b8a7b4e4deb5d9be60f0` | Sixteen visible checks passed across audit, tests, execution and CodeQL. This does not change canonical ownership: the VM source remains under `a-townchain/components/vm`. |
| `atc-zkp` | `52ce48442f42b65db1bd602a480971bc2ba9e9c7` | Determinism failed ([run](https://github.com/A-TownChain-Okosystems/atc-zkp/actions/runs/37808654557/job/113419478727)); visible audit, Cargo, Rust and CodeQL checks passed. |
| `atclang` | `4d07524b06d01d3633f97192aa0d19c97d678990` | One visible Python analysis check passed; complete test/security evidence was not returned for this main SHA. |
| `aurora-ai` | `74074f6b4a4ae992b14f5af79e1faa8a96ef3b00` | Python and JavaScript/TypeScript analysis passed; current main check query did not return the full build/test suite. |
| `demo-repository` | `d9b0da9c966dea02586b6be64139e6b3cd669dfd` | Two visible build checks passed; this is a GitHub demo/template, not an ecosystem product-readiness claim. |
| `genesis-chronicles` | `685e2053d3f9f9439a02f6208e4c7072e7c39493` | Four visible dependency/analysis checks passed; the checked-in evidence registry's test pass is bound to an older SHA, not this current main SHA. |
| `genesis-engine` | `f01c5169862702c1377b3c631ad329fda119f262` | Five visible audit, Cargo and analysis checks passed. |
| `genesis-franchise-factory` | `b393fde3630d2f4bc4d422442642af19e90bd9d6` | Twenty visible checks were returned; quality gates, audit and analysis checks passed. |
| `globus-os` | `aad164fb21f82025043ade4e1dad8740fcc65b69` | One visible JavaScript/TypeScript analysis check passed; the current-main query did not return the full Rust/System/Test gate set. PR #46's separate documentation head had failed System CI, ATC Test Suite and Rust CI. |

This table is a snapshot of **available check-run records**, not a guarantee that every repository has the same set of required checks. Empty/incomplete results remain UNKNOWN, not PASS. The open documentation PR heads are summarized separately below because their checks can differ from main.

## PR-head CI evidence sampled during this refresh

The observations below are tied to the listed PR head SHAs and workflow runs returned by GitHub on 2026-10-09. A pass applies only to that workflow on that SHA; it does not independently verify the whole repository or product.

**Coverage limit:** This is a targeted CI snapshot for PR heads touched during this refresh, not a complete CI audit of all 26 non-archived repositories. No CI state is inferred for repositories absent from this table.

## Refresh procedure

1. Fetch the current repository inventory and exclude archived repositories from the active refresh queue.
2. For every non-archived repository, inspect `README.md`, `STATUS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, canonical registry entries and exact-SHA evidence.
3. Resolve ownership against the SSOT boundaries above before changing claims.
4. Commit documentation changes on a dedicated branch and submit a PR; do not edit generated registry views manually.
5. Re-run required workflows after a documentation commit; a previous SHA's result is not evidence for the new head.
6. Keep claims conservative where evidence is missing, inaccessible, stale, or not tied to the current source SHA.
